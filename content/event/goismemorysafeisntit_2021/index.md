abstract: "One of the features of the programming language Go is that it is memory-safe. For example, if you want to access an invalid memory address, e.g., a field of a slice, in a *hello world* example without concurrency and the unsafe API, you will get a runtime error. However, when using the *correct code*, it is possible to access the memory. In this talk, I'll shortly introduce you to the problem, hopefully provide you an idea of the limitations of Go's memory safety, and offer you some resources for your deep-dive."
