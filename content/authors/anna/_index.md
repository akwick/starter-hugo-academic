I am a doctoral research in the Software Technology Group supervised by Prof. Mezini. 
Currently, I focus on security problems caused by API-misuses, e.g., for cryptographic APIs.
A well-known problem of cryptography in software is that cryptographic APIs are used in an insecure way. 
An example is that developers use ECB as a block mode for encryption which is known to be insecure. 
Within my research, we want to support developers to write secure code.

As part of my research within CROSSING, I am a contributor to the official [Eclipse Plugin CogniCrypt](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.cognicrypt) which supports developers in using cryptographic APIs securely. Further, I contributed to the [explainer video about CogniCrypt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwI3Jv06fxg).
